# Datepicker UI Project

## Overview

In this project, you are required to create a simple datepicker UI using only HTML and CSS. It will not be a functional datepicker, but a static UI component that you can later enhance with JavaScript.

The goal of this project is to help you practice positioning, layout, and styling techniques in CSS. Below is a rough mockup showing the datepicker UI you need to create.

## Design Requirements

The datepicker should include:
- A simple input field with placeholder text "dd / mm / yyyy"
- A calendar icon button
- An absolutely positioned calendar dropdown showing:
  - Month navigation (December 2022 in the example)
  - Days of the week header (S M T W T F S)
  - Calendar grid with dates

## Key Features

- **No JavaScript Required**: Focus purely on HTML and CSS implementation
- **Static UI Component**: Creates a solid foundation for future interactive functionality
